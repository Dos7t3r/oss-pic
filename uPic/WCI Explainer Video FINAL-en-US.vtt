00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.262
Hello and welcome to ISP 100,
offered by the Institute for the Study of

24502880-ee0a-4afe-9882-5b5c9336362f-1
00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:18.640
University Pedagogy, or ISUP.

f66e37af-b22f-4fae-9d3a-eb4553f68307-0
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.120
We're glad that you are here with us
today.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.680
This video is designed to give you a bit
more information on the Writing Check In.

d983b290-0cb4-4453-bb67-ff228d80af39-0
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.992
The Writing Check in has been designed to
assess your writing skills to ensure that

d983b290-0cb4-4453-bb67-ff228d80af39-1
00:00:32.992 --> 00:00:35.320
you can benefit from taking ISP 100.

77bcc22e-ae38-445c-9c62-879ee8ede0a3-0
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.282
It helps us recognize who would benefit
from additional exposure to some of the

77bcc22e-ae38-445c-9c62-879ee8ede0a3-1
00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:45.160
core components of written communication
in academic English.

f28ac838-318e-4ec2-a122-97195c066ec3-0
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.920
There are two outcomes from the Writing
Check In.

5605f684-f558-4df6-8193-35f700c77e79-0
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.040
Pass and Do not pass.

657b63db-3e6c-406f-855d-151b7f31dfdc-0
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.840
Students who pass remain in ISP 100 and
continue on with the course as usual.

8a180316-7489-472a-9e58-e774e0a93533-0
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.382
If the results of your writing check in
suggest that you will not yet fully

8a180316-7489-472a-9e58-e774e0a93533-1
00:01:02.382 --> 00:01:07.312
benefit from the instruction offered in
ISP 100 and that you are in the Do Not

8a180316-7489-472a-9e58-e774e0a93533-2
00:01:07.312 --> 00:01:10.806
Pass category,
you will be encouraged to instead enroll

8a180316-7489-472a-9e58-e774e0a93533-3
00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:13.926
in ISP010,
which is a free non credit course that

8a180316-7489-472a-9e58-e774e0a93533-4
00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:16.360
focuses on foundational writing skills.

a3f7da7b-b4ee-4120-a201-2b600b893008-0
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.320
If you are in the Do Not Pass category,
you will be unenrolled from ISP 100.

f3134cde-1182-46c7-8835-666a6e4ca634-0
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.613
However,
you will be eligible and encouraged to re

f3134cde-1182-46c7-8835-666a6e4ca634-1
00:01:26.613 --> 00:01:29.800
enroll in ISP 100 during a subsequent
term.

66b6b51a-8cba-407a-bf8a-f3f8e26c32b9-0
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.851
In that case,
the skills learned in ISP 10 will better

66b6b51a-8cba-407a-bf8a-f3f8e26c32b9-1
00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:37.480
prepare you to succeed in ISP 100.

20e616a0-076f-4385-8b7f-3884fdb8ff33-0
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.553
When you complete the writing check in,
you'll be asked to write a short academic

20e616a0-076f-4385-8b7f-3884fdb8ff33-1
00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:43.840
essay.

d6b3bb81-9b38-45f0-9d76-632028d0496b-0
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.840
We will get into this in a moment.

a8ed0317-40cc-4742-8923-b5a2a37734cd-0
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.374
First,
your professor is going to start by

a8ed0317-40cc-4742-8923-b5a2a37734cd-1
00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.195
giving you an article to read,
and you should read that article

a8ed0317-40cc-4742-8923-b5a2a37734cd-2
00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:51.680
thoroughly.

800c86d8-ff61-48fb-9516-71b61af714d9-0
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.560
You should also think about how you might
respond to what you've read.

96ed53a7-7fce-4739-a85e-55b7fa7ea2ed-0
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.536
You could, for example,
agree or disagree with the ideas

96ed53a7-7fce-4739-a85e-55b7fa7ea2ed-1
00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:01.000
presented in the article.

f56a6a93-5a25-43e4-ae5a-f2d05574798d-0
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.634
Or you could extend one of the arguments
in the article or connect it to your own

f56a6a93-5a25-43e4-ae5a-f2d05574798d-1
00:02:05.634 --> 00:02:06.160
experience.

9b47ec6f-ee91-4af3-91d2-678c4505e794-0
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.413
Regardless of what you choose,
you should start to think about why you

9b47ec6f-ee91-4af3-91d2-678c4505e794-1
00:02:10.413 --> 00:02:11.320
agree or disagree.

2f5ebb99-767a-4a1b-b00c-cb96295b4292-0
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.880
Focusing on this why piece will help you
form a claim to structure your essay.

531a84bc-fc99-4b33-853d-3c60fa4ac236-0
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.040
I will return to this in a moment.

234c8f90-969d-4157-b21d-287f89ff4606-0
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.826
You have access to the article on Quercus
and you will also be given a hard copy of

234c8f90-969d-4157-b21d-287f89ff4606-1
00:02:24.826 --> 00:02:27.320
it when you complete the writing check in.

76cd4a79-ad4d-4f97-ba85-42a094154a36-0
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.987
During the assessment,
you'll be free to review the article,

76cd4a79-ad4d-4f97-ba85-42a094154a36-1
00:02:31.987 --> 00:02:34.720
make notes, underline, highlight,
etcetera.

fa28a516-b408-4a63-9571-2b7a22a0101e-0
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.513
You should plan to write 4 paragraphs,
a short introduction, 2 body paragraphs,

fa28a516-b408-4a63-9571-2b7a22a0101e-1
00:02:40.513 --> 00:02:41.880
and a short conclusion.

2966cb53-8f98-4541-be48-f7c97559a561-0
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.200
The introduction should contain an
explicit claim.

25a5e56c-ecbe-43ee-a8c3-e00bc9f31484-0
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.840
Something like this would work.

4838aa68-a1f3-422b-bc16-8541682e3a8b-0
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.480
I agree with the author's assertions
about blank for two reasons.

97e2adc3-9f6c-4d59-b37b-f544c78c8a42-0
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.080
X&amp;Y.

70ebad46-a016-4895-96e8-1e7e213a79f2-0
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.961
The two body paragraphs should each be
devoted to exploring one of the reasons

70ebad46-a016-4895-96e8-1e7e213a79f2-1
00:02:58.961 --> 00:03:00.360
you state in your claim.

c01f14b9-8a4a-46f9-8f09-0f66ebdd8fc3-0
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.534
When you write the body paragraphs,
you should paraphrase evidence from the

c01f14b9-8a4a-46f9-8f09-0f66ebdd8fc3-1
00:03:04.534 --> 00:03:06.080
article to support your reasoning.

7ddced42-1d6e-423d-b2ff-2f49076eeebf-0
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.444
Beyond that,
you should aim to use transitional

7ddced42-1d6e-423d-b2ff-2f49076eeebf-1
00:03:09.444 --> 00:03:12.200
phrases to move between sentences and
paragraphs.

3d1dffcc-0d13-48d8-9799-125b6fc94296-0
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.680
There are many kinds of transitional
phrases, but here are some good examples.

775ecbb0-9a73-407b-820b-63cb2e0bbb95-0
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.160
1st, I will begin by discussing X.

4256d668-1420-45fd-b7c9-4adc524b29f7-0
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.680
Now I will move on to discuss why.

7f143f52-5c09-4e57-be8c-81c7c1f46f6a-0
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.471
And in conclusion,
it's obviously a good idea to avoid

7f143f52-5c09-4e57-be8c-81c7c1f46f6a-1
00:03:28.471 --> 00:03:32.177
errors,
but overall you should aim to write a

7f143f52-5c09-4e57-be8c-81c7c1f46f6a-2
00:03:32.177 --> 00:03:35.400
comprehensible, structured formal essay.

5b58463b-062f-480e-92ab-e0daebcbaa23-0
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.216
This means avoiding contractions and
slang,

5b58463b-062f-480e-92ab-e0daebcbaa23-1
00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:41.960
but you are free to make I statements.

9f5e4071-02a2-492e-ac3d-f74cd5fd82ae-0
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.729
Regardless of the approach you take,
your essay should include a claim that

9f5e4071-02a2-492e-ac3d-f74cd5fd82ae-1
00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:50.819
you support with your own reasoning
combined with evidence from the article

9f5e4071-02a2-492e-ac3d-f74cd5fd82ae-2
00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:51.680
provided to you.

32a9585c-02a8-4b62-a587-bce84eda2d85-0
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.234
There is no need to seek additional
information or cite other sources,

32a9585c-02a8-4b62-a587-bce84eda2d85-1
00:03:57.234 --> 00:04:02.520
and you do not need to follow a specific
citation format such as APA or MLA.

15d6bb58-3ae2-4403-8259-4f3442345213-0
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.735
Just to recap,
you should write 4 paragraphs,

15d6bb58-3ae2-4403-8259-4f3442345213-1
00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:11.280
a short introduction, 2 body paragraphs,
and a short conclusion.

35ade1ce-4e4c-4950-9703-378353509837-0
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.283
You should write using a formal academic
tone that avoids using contractions or

35ade1ce-4e4c-4950-9703-378353509837-1
00:04:16.283 --> 00:04:18.882
slang,
and you should aim to write as legibly as

35ade1ce-4e4c-4950-9703-378353509837-2
00:04:18.882 --> 00:04:19.360
possible.

1bca068d-c6d3-4920-970c-e1ef34b3a54c-0
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.110
Now I am going to discuss the grading
rubric so you have a strong understanding

1bca068d-c6d3-4920-970c-e1ef34b3a54c-1
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.160
of how your writing will be assessed.

80126233-c273-4e86-aac9-015c879a96c9-0
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.490
As we work through this rubric,
I want you to keep in mind that this is a

80126233-c273-4e86-aac9-015c879a96c9-1
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.801
starting point for university writing,
and you will see similar but more

80126233-c273-4e86-aac9-015c879a96c9-2
00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:41.640
advanced versions of this rubric as you
proceed through ISP 100.

78a22f26-7643-4821-8ce3-c811092dc9b5-0
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.591
This rubric has five sections,
audience awareness, organization,

78a22f26-7643-4821-8ce3-c811092dc9b5-1
00:04:48.591 --> 00:04:53.600
paragraphing, evidence and source, Usage,
and mechanics.

37dbbc33-db39-4be9-89a3-e595f4cb52be-0
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.400
It also has three options, good, marginal,
or inadequate.

14b7ee98-ae33-4d15-b869-7640a7eb4128-0
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.880
It takes a score of 14 or higher to
successfully pass the writing check in.

20d5e06f-9b4b-4ed1-8f68-c3508d017bf7-0
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.760
Let's go through each of these sections.

420b5683-2684-4bce-864f-f0ea23ca0c42-0
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.712
When considering your audience,
we are looking to see if you can write in

420b5683-2684-4bce-864f-f0ea23ca0c42-1
00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:14.600
a tone that is appropriate for an
academic audience.

0a055770-1e0f-4684-a165-71c42efd29f8-0
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.788
This generally means that you are writing
formally and without any slang or

0a055770-1e0f-4684-a165-71c42efd29f8-1
00:05:19.788 --> 00:05:20.560
contractions.

a4053426-3787-4586-bb77-21b8cd0d1f51-0
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.028
At the highest level,
we would expect to see tone and language

a4053426-3787-4586-bb77-21b8cd0d1f51-1
00:05:25.028 --> 00:05:28.480
that are completely appropriate for an
academic audience.

b600b72b-0abf-4cef-8fcc-31b38e0f3e37-0
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.396
In terms of organization,
we want you to be able to develop a

b600b72b-0abf-4cef-8fcc-31b38e0f3e37-1
00:05:33.396 --> 00:05:38.424
logical response that presents a well
organized argument that is easy for the

b600b72b-0abf-4cef-8fcc-31b38e0f3e37-2
00:05:38.424 --> 00:05:39.520
reader to follow.

f8e5c40d-0531-47e5-92b2-7706d88866ac-0
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.621
At the highest level,
your essay would demonstrate a clearly

f8e5c40d-0531-47e5-92b2-7706d88866ac-1
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:49.840
organized argument with signposts to
guide the reader for paragraphing.

7fb80a9f-2ba9-4e46-aa48-8bf5d9598aa4-0
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.480
We are assessing whether you can stay on
topic and focused on a single idea.

59630c60-85c1-401f-94ba-65dbf5ebe3aa-0
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.167
When it comes to evidence,
we are looking to see that you can

59630c60-85c1-401f-94ba-65dbf5ebe3aa-1
00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:03.719
integrate information from the article
